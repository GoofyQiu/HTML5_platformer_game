Educational Platformer Game(forked from my Gatech Enterprise github repo for public access)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is made with MelonJS, a light-weight Javascript game engine. The purpose of this game is to 
help English words learning/reinforcing. The game is mainly designed for kids. 
I also meant to practice Javascript programming in making this game. The game is still a prototype.
Any feedback will be appreciated and I will use them as inspiration for game design should I decide to continue this project
Thank you

The game is hosted on Itch.io
